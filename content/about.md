Hi, I’m Alex, a driven software engineer with a passion for crafting impactful solutions. I’ve been with [Trade Republic](https://traderepublic.com) since November 2018, where I’ve played an integral role in building a product that empowers everyone to create wealth with easy and free access to investments. So far we've reached more than 8 million people in 17 countries and hold customer assets worth over 100 billion euros. I specialize in using Kotlin, Vert.x, Postgres, RabbitMQ, and Kubernetes to create scalable, reliable, and efficient systems that deliver real value to our customers. I approach every challenge with a pragmatic mindset and take full ownership of my work to ensure we achieve the best outcomes.

Before joining Trade Republic, I worked at [Valsight](https://valsight.com), where I developed software for simulation-based strategic planning, gaining valuable experience in creating complex, high-performance applications. My academic journey includes a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in IT-Systems Engineering from [Hasso Plattner Institute](https://hpi.de), with a 12-month internship at [SAP Labs](https://www.sap.com/about/company/innovation/labs.html) in Palo Alto, California between my undergraduate and graduate studies.

Outside of coding, I’m passionate about weight lifting, photography, and enjoying a well-brewed cup of coffee. I believe in maintaining a good balance between mental focus and physical strength to keep both my mind and body sharp.
